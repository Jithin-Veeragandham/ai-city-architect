    Implements the hill climbing algorithm to optimize the placement of intersections in a city grid.

    Steps:
    1. Iteratively generates neighboring configurations and evaluates their fitness scores.
    2. Accepts a new configuration if it improves the fitness score.
    3. Saves the grid visualization at each step for progress tracking.

    Parameters:
        grid (list[list[int]]): The initial city grid with intersections.
        max_iterations (int): Maximum number of iterations for the algorithm.

    Returns:
